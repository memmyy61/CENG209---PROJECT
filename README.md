CENG209 System Programming Project - Minecraft: Dungeons

Minecraft: Dungeons game is based on exploring rooms, fighting enemies. You start the game at a starting point. 

First you have to move to other rooms. You must use the ‘move’ command to move to other rooms. You must also specify which direction you want to go. For example, you want to go to the right, you should write ‘move right’. The game is not case sensitive, so you must write all commands in lower case.
When you come to a new room, the name of the room will be written on the screen. With the ‘look’ command you can see what is inside the room and its description. There may be items and enemies in the rooms. With the ‘look’ command, you can see what the items are for and the health and damage of the enemies.

You have an inventory in the game and it is limited to 3 items. You can use the ‘inventory’ command to view your inventory. You must use ‘pickup item_name’ to collect the items in the room. For example, if there is ‘Apple’ in the room, you should write ‘pickup Apple’. Some items are unimportant in the game, if you want to drop them from the inventory, you can use the ‘drop item_name’ command. If you want to use the items, you can use the ‘use item_name’ command. 

If you want to fight with enemies, you can use the ‘attack’ command. The battle mechanics are turn-based. First the enemy will damage you, then you will damage the enemy, and so on until someone dies. If you die in the game, you will have to start over. As you kill enemies, it will be reflected in your stats. You can use the ‘stats’ command to see your statistics. With this command you can see how many lives you have left, the damage you have done to the enemy and the number of enemies you have killed.

Finally, in order to complete the game, you must kill all enemies on the map and reach the end point. If you want to exit the game, you can use the ‘exit’ command, but remember that you will start from the beginning when you want to play again.

Have fun
